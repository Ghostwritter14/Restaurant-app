# What is this Project About
This is a small scale version of a restaurant application.
Nowadays, every restaurant chain uses an interface where the customer can check the menu_items and prices and detail of an item. This app captures that Idea.
Additionally, the program also entails a backend for the chefs to interact with in what dish is available in the specific chain for the moment. 

This programme was created using the Django framework of Python along with html/css(bootstrap) and Jinja2.
